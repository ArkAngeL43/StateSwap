# StateSwap
This tool is built in Python with compiled binaries from PyInstaller and currently only supports Windows machines.

## Setup and usage
Python is not needed to run this application, the only setup needed is installing the bin folder and batch file to run the program. After downloading both, run the batch script and enter the two country tags you want to swap, the swapped state files will be located in the OUT subdirectory.
